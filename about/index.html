        <p>I study a mix of physics, computer science, applied math, and bioengineering at Princeton.</p>
        <p>My work is broadly focused on using quantitative methods and engineering to achieve human quality of life and lifespan maxima through research and entrepreneurship. By night, I'm improving at jazz drumming and bringing personal projects to life.</p>
        <p>I always enjoy thinking about big ideas. If you like them too, get in touch.</p>
