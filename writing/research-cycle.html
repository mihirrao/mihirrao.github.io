        <h1>Science Cycle</h1>
        <p>The primary purpose of research publications is to transmit information about scientific methods and/or results and/or ideas from a scientist, or likely a set of scientists, to all other scientists and maybe even the general public.</p>
        <p>This is consistent with the macro-cycle that is the human scientific endeavor:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Start with a baseline set of ideas and facts, as well as a toolkit of methodologies.</li>
            <li>Derive a specific research motivation from (1), which could be driven by a variety of things like delivering social good, birthing lucrative products and industries, or mere intellectual curiosity.</li>
            <li>Develop a specific idea that encompasses how one can effectively act on the motivation cultivated in (2).</li>
            <li>Execute methodology (which may be preceded by its invention or development) that brings the idea developed in (3) to life. This may involve but is not limited to experimental, theoretical, computational, or merely even conjectural methods.</li>
            <li>Discover the direct consequences of the methods executed in (4). These are the raw results (measurements, theoretical derivations, etc.), minimally influenced by subjective interpretation.</li>
            <li>Introduce any new ideas and facts from (5), as well as novel methodology produced in (4), to the original sets of ideas, facts, and methods, respectively, making them available in (1) for all scientists, and as a progress report of sorts to scientists and the general public alike.</li>
        </ol>
