        <h1>Get to John</h1>
        <p>LAB (theory/basic science/method/tool) ⇄ LAB (method/tool/translational) ⇄ MARKET → John Doe</p>
        <p>Time scales to go from theory to John vary; completion is only guaranteed if someone truly cares about John more than the elegance of the science and possible financial gains along the way. As a scientist, take ownership of and responsibility for the success of the endgame, or you risk getting stuck in Springer's servers.</p>
        <p>End-to-end individual oversight may not be practical in most cases, but effective delegation and people management is, and improving the connectivity between components of the above flow means John has a better chance of getting his pills.</p>
