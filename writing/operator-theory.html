        <h1>Notes on Operator Theory</h1>
        <p>Dec 14, 2023: Wolfram recently dropped <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/12/observer-theory/" target="_blank">this</a> bomb, so I thought I would share some very similar ideas I have been casually compiling in my Notion workspace for several months.</p>

        <p>If this gets to somebody who can convert this into something more rigorous, fantastic. In the meantime, I’ll maintain this as a live document in the spirit of open idea exchange, providing updates in chronological order.</p>

        <p><strong>First entry - sometime in April 2023</strong></p>

        <ul>
        <li>Physical reality is unique to the basis of an operator (observer-esque)</li>
        <li>The physical hardware/capabilities of our neural system determine our perception and reasoning about the world</li>
        <li>“Seeing is believing” ⇒ “Believing is seeing”</li>
        <li>Account for the fact that this theory is being formulated in the human basis (using the hardware of the human brain and the performance of human consciousness)</li>
        <li>This entire idea may or may not be connected to questions surrounding consciousness itself and therefore quantum wave function collapse and other things (maybe)</li>
        <li>This whole thing may be obsolete given Wolfram’s hypergraph physics project (TBD; need to learn more about it).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>July 26, 2023 - Update with some more thoughts</strong></p>

        <ul>
        <li>Operator theory could be an abstract study, from which things about our universe can be thought about (perhaps analogously like with the Wolfram physics project).</li>
        <li>The env (psi) is a global system with affiliated ground truth properties, within which all operators exist. For different reasons, including hardware (brain wiring), etc., each operator has some finite amount of information about either some or all of the env. Additionally, for similar reasons, different operators have different abilities to understand the ground truth version of env. The concept of a global operator with complete knowledge of ground truth (whether ground truth is finite or infinite) is an interesting thought.</li>
        <li>Operators and env interact. Env can be measured by operator to then expand its knowledge base (information access). Then, from the basis of some operator, env appears to be something that is based on the total knowledge of the operator (gamma). Thus, env for an operator is a function of gamma. Thus, env must be described either in an abstract ground truth basis (global operator basis) or in the basis of a non-global operator.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Update - Dec 1, 2023</strong></p>

        <ul>
        <li>One possible starting point is hypothesizing that information processing is fundamental to the perception of realities. We can consider a common signal (possibly a bitstream or wavelike) being fed into different information processing “architectures” and, thus, perceiving different realities. Show that, for the different architectures, there are fundamental limitations to how the input information can be processed and, therefore, forcing a different perceived reality. The degree to which the realities are different could be a function of how different the architectures are, and this can possibly be theoretically quantified.</li>
        <li>Conscious relativity. Frames of consciousness. Perhaps there is a “ground truth” observer that is needed for calculations in this theory. So really there is no notion of a ground truth, just different realities in different frames of consciousness. An approach to grasping this could be to say for some input information signal, a certain observer architecture (maybe consisting of sensors of the signal and processing components) perceives a certain reality. Then, for the same input signal, perturb the architecture and compute the effects of the perceived reality. Keep in mind all of this is being done in our individual human frames of consciousness.</li>
