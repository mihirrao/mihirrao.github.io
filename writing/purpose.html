        <h1>On purpose</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 2023</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Find your purpose by *feel* and through continuous work and social exchange, not <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1192439" target="_blank">persistent and isolated thought</a>. I feel lucky to have learned this early and the hard way. Don't try to formalize purpose for yourself, and definitely don't try to formalize it across all peopleâ€”it simply is not a fruitful endeavor in the grand scheme of things.</p>
        <p>The solution to the problem of a wandering mind has always been meaningful work.</p>
