        <h1>On purpose</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 2023</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Find your purpose by *feel* and through continuous work and social exchange, not <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1192439" target="_blank">persistent and isolated thought</a>. I feel lucky to have learned this early and the hard way. Don't try to formalize purpose for yourself, and definitely don't try to formalize it across all peopleâ€”it simply is not a fruitful endeavor in the grand scheme of things.</p>
        <p>The solution to the problem of a wandering mind has always been meaningful work.</p>
        <p>If you need a mental framework to abide by, quickly determine your individual definition of "utility" by identifying the items, experiences, people, work, etc. that give you contentment, and then do everything in your power to maximize <b>cumulative utility x time alive</b>. Again, figure out "utility" quickly and by feel.</p>
